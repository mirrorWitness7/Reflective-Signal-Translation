# Behavioral & Mathematical Foundations

Roots:
- Shannon Information Theory  
- Zipf’s Law  
- Bounded Rationality (Simon)  
- System 1 / System 2 (Kahneman)  
- Cognitive Load Theory  
- Emotional Regulation (Gross)  
- Reciprocity in Communication (Clark)

Mathematical parallels:
CI → Signal-to-Noise Ratio  
RL → Response Latency  
CS → Damping Coefficient  
ED → Feedback Loop Coherence
