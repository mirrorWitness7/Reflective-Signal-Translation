# Ethical Framework for Reflective Signal Translation (RST)

RST does not interpret emotion, personality, or psychological state.  
It observes structural communication features â€” pacing, density, tone consistency.

**Ethical Anchors:**
1. **Informed Interaction:** Users should be aware that signal metrics (CI, RL, CS, ED) may be computed for adaptation.
2. **Right to Silence:** Silence is respected as data, not forced engagement.
3. **Transparency:** System may surface meta-data on request.
4. **Data Boundaries:** No biometric or private logs required; textual data only.

RST aims to make quiet communication legible, not to psychoanalyse it.
